1. what is virtual DOM?
-> virtual DOM is a representation of the actual DOM. It is exactly the copy of the actual DOM. It is used in an algorithm known as diffing algorithm.

2. what is diffing algorithm?
-> React uses this algorithm to diff one tree(new virtual DOM) with other(old virtual DOM). It finds out what is exactly changed in the DOM so it can do reconciliation.

3. what is reconciliation?
-> reconciliation is the process in which react renders the changed part in the DOM.
