Library is something that contains the code that some other developer wrote and we can reuse that code in our applications.
Framework is bigger than a Library and it is also contains the code that other developer wrote
If we want develop a application we didn't need to start from the scratch by using frameworks we saves time and risk of errors
The main difference between Library and Framework is Inversion of control
